**Pipeline Alternatives -- NVIDIA Vulkan Compute Mipmaps Sample**

<small>Authors: David Zhao Akeley </small>

This document summarizes how you can test alternative fast and general
pipelines that fit into the `nvpro_pyramid` framework.


# Steps

The steps for this are:

* Enable this functionality in CMake.

* Create a new directory in `extras/fast_pipelines` or
  `extras/general_pipelines`.

* Implement the shader in a new GLSL file in the new directory.

* Add a `.cpp` file implementing the dispatcher function for the
  pipeline and register the dispatcher by name (to be explained).

* Re-run CMake so that the new `.cpp` file is added to the executable.

* Add the pipeline alternative to the list in `demo_app/mipmap_pipelines.cpp`


# CMake

Enable this functionality by running CMake with the
`PIPELINE_ALTERNATIVES` configuration variable set to `1` or greater.


# New Directory

Create a new directory in `extras/fast_pipelines` if implementing
a fast pipeline alternative, `extras/general_pipelines`
otherwise.  The directory name becomes the name of the pipeline
alternative. It is okay if there is a fast pipeline and a general
pipeline with the same name.


# New Shader

In the new directory, create the shader file under the name
`fast_pipeline_alternative.glsl` or `general_pipeline_alternative.glsl`
depending on pipeline type. The technical difference between the two
is that a general pipeline should be able to handle any image size, while
a fast pipeline does not.

This file must declare the workgroup size and the `void
nvproPyramidMain()` function. It may use any `NVPRO_PYRAMID_*` macros
documented in `nvpro_pyramid/nvpro_pyramid.glsl`. (This file
defines optional macros to fallback values if not
provided). Additionally, the shader may use these macros (derived from
`NVPRO_PYRAMID_PUSH_CONSTANT`):

* `NVPRO_PYRAMID_INPUT_LEVEL_`: by convention, the input level for
  this dispatch.

* `NVPRO_PYRAMID_LEVEL_COUNT_`: by convention, the number of levels to
  fill for this dispatch.

Note the trailing underscores. If you want to match the style of the
original shader, use `lowerCamelCase_` style names, with the trailing
underscore. Furthermore, the fast pipelines use only
`NVPRO_PYRAMID_REDUCE4` and `NVPRO_PYRAMID_LOAD_REDUCE4`, and no other
load/reduce macros.  This is documented by
`nvpro_pyramid/nvpro_pyramid.glsl`, but is not enforced for testing
alternative fast pipelines.

If you call a macro with a non-trivial expression, be sure to
parenthesize if needed to avoid precedence errors:

!!! ERROR Wrong
    `NVPRO_PYRAMID_LOAD_REDUCE4(tileCoord_ + ivec2(2, 0), inputLevel_, sample_);`

    `// Could become sample_ = textureLod(tileCoord_ + ivec(2, 0) / imageSize_, inputLevel_);`

!!! TIP Correct
    `NVPRO_PYRAMID_LOAD_REDUCE4((tileCoord_ + ivec2(2, 0)), inputLevel_, sample_);`


# Dispatcher Function

In the same directory as the shader, create a `.cpp` file that

* Includes `nvpro_pyramid_dispatch_alternative.hpp`.

* Defines a function for recording suitable dispatch commands
  for the pipeline you implemented. See `nvpro_pyramid_dispatcher_t`
  in `nvpro_pyramid/nvpro_pyramid_dispatch.hpp` for documentation.

* If the pipeline is a fast pipeline, add the dispatcher function to
  the global dispatcher map using the macro

  `NVPRO_PYRAMID_ADD_FAST_DISPATCHER(dispatcher name, functionName)`

  The dispatcher name is **not** quoted. Typically, the dispatcher
  name is the same as the pipeline alternative name (i.e. the
  directory name) but this is not required.

* If the pipeline is a general pipeline, instead add the dispatcher
  function using

  `NVPRO_PYRAMID_ADD_GENERAL_DISPATCHER(dispatcher name, functionName)`

Re-run CMake so that this new file is compiled into the
`vk_compute_mipmaps_demo` executable.

For a very simple example, see
`extras/fast_pipelines/onelevel/onelevel.cpp`. This dispatches a
pipeline that only handles an even-sized input image, and generates
only 1 mip level.


# Add Alternative

In `demo_app/mipmap_pipelines.cpp`, add an entry in the
`pipelineAlternatives[]` array with syntax

``` text
    { string label for GUI and and benchmark entry,
      { general pipeline dispatcher name,
        general pipeline name (defaults to dispatcher name),
        general pipeline config bits },
      { fast pipeline dispatcher name,
        fast pipeline name (defaults to dispatcher name),
        fast pipeline config bits }}
```

All parameters, except the label name, can be omitted to use default values.

!!! TIP Useful Config Bits
    The `srgbSharedBit` is useful for testing correct usage of
    `NVPRO_PYRAMID_TYPE` vs `NVPRO_PYRAMID_SHARED_TYPE`. Also,
    hopefully `noBilinearBit` will convince you of the need for
    `NVPRO_PYRAMID_LOAD_REDUCE4`.

!!! WARNING
    If the new entry doesn't show up, double check that you've re-run
    CMake with `-DPIPELINE_ALTERNATIVES=1` (or higher) and that the
    entry isn't removed by an `#if` directive.


# Benchmarking

Once the new pipeline alternative is included in the `pipelineAlternatives`
list, its results will be included in the benchmark, which can be started
using the "start benchmark" button in the UI.

!!! TIP Magenta Areas
    The sample clears all mip levels (except the base level) to magenta
    before testing the pipeline. This can be used to diagnose shaders that
    fail to fill certain areas of the output.

    The `-pipeline` and `-o` command line options may be useful for
    inspecting such issues more closely.

!!! TIP Visual Studio
    When run from the solution explorer, the JSON benchmark results seem to
    get written to `build/demo_app`.
